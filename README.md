# 🌳 Capstone Project G30 - Tree Level Change Detection Across Maharashtra State

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting and analyzing tree cover changes across Maharashtra State using **Very High-Resolution Satellite Imagery** and **Deep Learning Techniques**.  
It aims to classify regions into vegetation density zones (Red, Orange, Green) and assist in awareness campaigns and afforestation planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- **Tree Population Analysis** – Efficiently assess changes in tree cover over time using geospatial data.
- **Zonal Classification** – Differentiate land areas into Red, Orange, and Green zones based on vegetation density.
- **Awareness & Plantation Planning** – Identify critical areas for afforestation and support targeted awareness initiatives.

## 📊 Project Outcomes
1. **Tree Population Analysis**  
   - Enables efficient assessment of tree cover changes in a specific region using AI-powered detection.

2. **Zonal Classification**  
   - Facilitates the classification of land into:
     - 🟥 **Red Zone** – Low vegetation density  
     - 🟧 **Orange Zone** – Moderate vegetation density  
     - 🟩 **Green Zone** – High vegetation density  

3. **Awareness and Plantation Planning**  
   - Highlights regions requiring afforestation efforts.  
   - Supports environmental awareness programs through targeted reporting.
